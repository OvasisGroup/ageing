## Updating the App

The app will automatically check for updates when you:

- After the app has been idle

You don't need to manually update - it happens seamlessly in the background.

## Troubleshooting

### "Install" button doesn't appear
- Ensure you're using HTTPS
- Try clearing your browser cache
- Make sure you haven't already installed it

### App not working offline

- Check that service worker is registered (DevTools > Application > Service Workers)

### Need to uninstall?
- **Desktop**: Right-click the app window title bar > "Uninstall"
- **Mobile**: Long-press the app icon > "Uninstall" or "Remove"

## For Developers

### Service Worker
The service worker is automatically generated by next-pwa and registered at `/sw.js`

### Cache Management
Caches are managed automatically. To manually clear:
```javascript
// In browser console
caches.keys().then(keys => {
  keys.forEach(key => caches.delete(key));
});
```

### Testing PWA
1. Build the production version: `pnpm build`
2. Start production server: `pnpm start`
3. Open DevTools > Lighthouse
4. Run PWA audit

### Updating Manifest
Edit `/public/manifest.json` and restart the dev server.

### Regenerating Icons
Run `node scripts/generate-icons.js` to regenerate all icon sizes from the source image.
